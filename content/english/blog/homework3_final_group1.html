<h1>Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance</h1>
<p>Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm">Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)</a> survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.</p>
<div id="load-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Load the data</h2>
<p>This data is part of the <code>openintro</code> textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:</p>

<p>Before you carry on with your analysis, it’s is always a good idea to check with <code>skimr::skim()</code> to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.</p>

<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>You will first start with analyzing the <code>weight</code> of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?</p>
<p><u><strong>NOTE AND ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>We have 1004 missing values in weight. The lowest weight is 30kgs and highest weight is 181 kgs. The mean weight of the class is 68kgs and median weight is 64kgs. We can see that Q3 is 76kgs. That means 75% of the weights are between 30kgs and 76kgs. As per the histogram, it’s clear that the remaining 25% of the data is really spread between 76kgs and 181kgs. This is evident in the skewness of the graph. It is right skewed and mean is larger than the median. It gives us an indication that there are some outliers that have increased the value of the mean.</p>

<p>Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are <em>NOT</em> active 3 or more days per week?</p>
<p><u><strong>ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>We are 95% confident that the proportion of participants that are not active for 3 or more days is within the lower bound of 0.3229 and the upper bound 0.3389.</p>
<p>Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?</p>
<p><u><strong>ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>We observe that there is a small positive relationship between weight and the amount of days physically active within a week. However, the difference in distribution is only minor. We conducted a small sanity check by means of calculating means and creating a best fit line plot. This confirmed that in fact the relationship between weight and physical activity is indeed small.</p>
<p>These findings are rather surprising! The intuition of our group was that people that are more physically active would weigh less. However, on second thought, there might be many other factors contributing to to the weight of a person apart from physical activity (e.g. diet, age, ect.). Physically active people might burn more calories, tough gain muscle weight.</p>

<p>There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.</p>

<h2>Hypothesis test with formula</h2>
<p>Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.</p>
<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong></u></p>
<p>Let x_bar_yes be the mean of students who exercise atleast 3 times a week. Let x_bar_no be the mean of students who exercise less than 3 times a week. We will define our null hypothesis as x_bar_yes - x_bar_no = 0. If the null hypothesis is true, on average, it would signify that the weight of those who do not exercise at least 3 times a week is the same as that of those who do.</p>

</div>
<div id="hypothesis-test-with-infer" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis test with <code>infer</code></h2>
<p>Next, we will introduce a new function, <code>hypothesize</code>, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as <code>obs_diff</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>obs_diff &lt;- yrbss %&gt;%
  drop_na(weight) %&gt;%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %&gt;% 
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %&gt;%

## Explanatory: physical_3plus (factor)
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##    stat
##   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1  1.77</code></pre>
<p>Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.</p>
<p>After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>null_dist &lt;- yrbss %&gt;%
  drop_na(weight) %&gt;%

<p>Here, <code>hypothesize</code> is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to <em>point</em> to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.</p>
<p>Also, note that the <code>type</code> argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.</p>
<p>We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/english/blog/homework3_final_group1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least <code>obs_stat</code> of 1.77?</p>
<p>We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function <code>infer::get_p_value()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>null_dist %&gt;% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;two-sided&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/english/blog/homework3_final_group1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>null_dist %&gt;%

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   p_value
##     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0</code></pre>
<p>This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.</p>

<h1>IMDB ratings: Differences between directors</h1>
<p>Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/directors.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find <code>geom_errorbar()</code> and <code>geom_rect()</code> useful.</p>
<p>In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the <code>t.test</code> command and the <code>infer</code> package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong>Answer:</strong></u></p>
<p>Null hypothesis: The difference between the mean ratings of the two director’s movies is zero.</p>
<p>Alternative hypothesis: The difference between the mean ratings of the two director’s movies is not zero.</p>
<p>t-stat: 2.7144 (using direct t_test)</p>
<p>p-value: 0.01078 (using t_test), 0.008 (using infer package)</p>
<p>Conclusion: The t-stat is greater than 2 ( the p-value is smaller than 0.05), so we should reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the mean ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton’s movies are not the same.</p>

<h1>Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination</h1>
<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<p>What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong>ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>Based on the analysis above, the mean salary of female group is lower than that of male, given the similar sample size. The variations/standard deviations for both genders are similar. Since t-stat is larger than the critical value of 2, we can reject our null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries between men and women is 0. We are 95% confident that there is a significant difference between the salaries of men and women.</p>
<p>You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> and with the simulation method from the <code>infer</code> package.</p>

<p><u><strong>ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>The p value from the t statistics is 0.0002 and the p value from get_p_value function is 0, which is much smaller than 0.05.

<div id="relationship-experience---gender" class="section level2">
<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Summary Statistics of salary by gender

<p>Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?</p>
<p><u><strong>ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>The p-value is 0.00001, which is much smaller than the critical value of 0.05. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that the mean difference between the work experience of men and women is 0. We are 95% confident that there is a significant difference between the work experience of men and women. This conclusion endangers our earlier conclusion that there is a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, since lesser work experience may be associated with lower salaries.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Experience ?</h2>
<p>Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.</p>
<p>Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data</p>

<div id="check-correlations-between-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Check correlations between the data</h2>
<p>You can use <code>GGally:ggpairs()</code> to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to <code>ggpairs()</code> with <code>aes</code> arguments to colour by <code>gender</code> and make ths plots somewhat transparent (<code>alpha  = 0.3</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>omega %&gt;% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %&gt;% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong>ANSWER:</strong></u></p>
<p>We have several findings as below:</p>
<p>1. Women’s work experience generally ranges from 0 to 5 years; the density plot is right-skewed. On the other hand, men’s work experience is more widely distributed and mainly concentrated around 20 years. We can infer that women are more likely to hold entry-level positions in companies with lower salaries. In comparison, men are more likely to have executive management in companies with higher salaries.</p>
<p>2. From the scatterplot of salary on experience, we can fit upward lines of best fit through the points in the scatterplot. This is backed up by the correlation numbers that are seen from the experience-salary section of the plot. Firstly, we see an overall correlation between salary and experience at 0.803 and is a positive value. That is to say, in general, regardless of gender, individuals with less experience are more likely to have low wages and vice versa. When the salary vs. experience analysis is split by gender, we see that the correlation for females is 0.812, and that of males is 0.661. From this, we can conclude that the the linear relationship between salary and experience is stronger for females than it is for men.</p>
<p><u><strong>ADDITINAL NOTE:</strong></u></p>
<p>3. By eyeballing the boxplots displayed within the ggpair plots, we can also back up our conclusions that we drew from the previous sections “Relationship Experience - Gender?”and “Relationship Salary - Gender?” - that there is a distinct experience gap and salary gap between men and women.</p>

<p><u><strong>NOTE:</strong></u></p>
<p>The plot shows several interesting patterns. Generalizing conclusions should made cautiously which is why especially the relationship of the parliament constituencies’ share of votes for the labour and/or conservative party and the corresponding leave share votes should not be over interpreted. However, the stronger trends for the Liberal Democrats as well as the Independent Party may show some interesting tendencies. While parliament constituencies in which the vote share for the Liberal Democrats was relatively low showed above 50% vote shares for Brexit, this vote share quickly depletes as the share of Liberal Democrats affiliation increases. An inverse relation with stronger magnitude is to be observed for the UKIP. In underrepresented parliament constituencies the vote share to leave the EU was relatively low but strongly increases as the affiliation to the UKIP grows. At around 20% representation of the UKIP in the parliament constituencies the vote shares were up to 75%. This finding should not come as a surprise, as the main campaign positions of the UKIP was to be independent of the EU whereas the Liberal Democrats campaigned to stay.</p>

<h1>Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory.

<p><u><strong>NOTE:</strong></u></p>
<p>As the graphs show, there is a small, but undeniable difference between the sum of all GDP components and the UN reported total GDP value. This might be surprising at first, but as clarified earlier, the calculation of the GDP as the sum of government spending, consumption, investments plus the net exports is rather of a simplistic nature. Simultaneously, it is very difficult to estimate the exact values for each individual component of GDP. We believe that in order to calculate the various components, the UN might have used adjusted values for a better estimate. Similarly, to not be effected by the many assumptions made to calculate the individual components, the UN might have opted to extrapolate the GDP total value based on a different, more rigorous approach.</p>
<p>The graphs do hint at another anomaly. There is a clear difference between the countries in terms of the accuracy of the sum of GDP’s components and the UN’s reported GDP value. Whilst it seems as if the values for Germany and the United Stated have aligned with the reported GDP amount, the GDP estimate for India remains different until the present day. This might be down to the relatively high quality of data for Germany’s and the USA’s economy as opposed to the data on India’s economy. Therefore, the UN might have been forced to fall back on assumptions and estimations that lead to less accurate representations of the true values.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These graphs depict some noteworthy differences, similarities and trends. For all three countries, though very different, there is a strong tendency for the trade balance/ net exports to play a small part in the the countries GDP share. However, this does not imply that there are not significant differences in the magnitude of the im- and exports between these countries. Though, it does hint at the fact that despite all three countries having a strong industry (India’s natural resources and tech sector, Germany’s automobile and chemical industry and USA’s oil and automobile sector) all strongly depend on foreign goods to cover their domestic demand. Therefore the net exports’ GDP share are almost negligible. Only Germany, who has been up-scaling their exporting of automobiles to eastern countries and especially China has been realizing a positively developing share of net exports.</p>
<p>In the meantime, household spending makes up the largest share of GDP for all countries around the 60% mark. While Germany and the USA have been steady in this area for the last few decades, India has realized a 15% drop in its share. This might be down to an increasing share of household finances being used to spend on foreign goods as the middle class in India grows. Another explanation might be that through the relatively stronger increase in other components of the GDP the household expenditures’ share decreases a result.</p>
<p>The investments in India are an exemplary increase that might have caused the share of household expenditures to decrease. India’s size and resources make it an interesting trade partner for many other global powers and throughout the last 20 years India has felt an increasing investment in its country. This is observable in especially its tech sector and infrastructure. The growth of companies such as SPAN Infotech and Tata as well foreign investment by China through its silk road initiative are driving forces in this trend.</p>
<p>The government expenditure on the other hand is relatively low in India. USA and Germany have witnessed around 10% higher government expenditure relative to their GDP, as they have more established governmental structures and tax systems as well as social benefit systems that allow as well as require for higher relative government expenditure, respectively.</p>

<p>The countries above have been chosen based on some of the nationalities of our group members.</p>
<p>The first observation is that the differences between the Netherlands and Germany are close to non-existent. Not only are the components’ shares similar, but the tends over the last 50 years are remarkably close: The share of net exports have been steadily increasing from around 0% to 10%, the government expenditure and gross capital formation have been around the 20 % mark and household expenditures have been steadily decreasing. This is where the only notable difference between the two countries lies and as the share of GDP based on household expenditures has been consistently 5-10 percentage points lower in the Dutch as opposed to the German economy.</p>
<p>The share distribution of the components for China are very much different to what could be observed for the two western European countries. The largest differences are in the share of government expenditure, gross capital formation and household expenditure. While the level of government expenditure is consistently lower than for its European counterparts, China’s GDP share of investment and household expenditure seem to have traded shares over the last 5 decades with investments on the rise especially in the last 20 years and the GDP share of household expenditures almost falling 20 percentage points. It is no groundbreaking finding, that China’s level of investments, both domestic and international has skyrocketed in the last 20 years, but the magnitude is astonishing. Especially considering the ever growing wealth and middle class in China would hint at the fact that household expenditures should increase tremendously. Yet still, investments in China strongly out way this trend as China has grown to be a country with among the fastest growing infrastructure and conglomerates.</p>
